## Description
We created the Movie Nights app to allow users to search for movies, and create a list for future viewing. Users can read a synopsis of movies they are interested in and watch trailers. After creating a list of movies to watch, a user can opt to have a movie selected at random for them to watch.

HTML, CSS and Javascript programing languages were used. The Tailwind CSS framework was used to simplify the style while making sure the website is appealing to users. Server side APIs were tenor, for GIFs, and IMDb, for movie synopsis and trailers.

One of the challenges we faced while developing this app were learning to work with the server side APIs. 

An idea for future development could include querying live streaming networks so users could know where to watch the movie selection.
