# Movie-Nights

## Description

We created the Movie Nights app to allow users to search for movies, and create a list for future viewing. Users can read a synopsis of movies they are interested in and watch trailers. A gif related to the movie is displayed in a modal when a user clicks on a movie. After creating a list of movies to watch, a user can opt to have a movie selected at random for them to watch.

HTML, CSS and Javascript programing languages were used. The Tailwind CSS framework was used to help create Movie Nights. Server side APIs were tenor, for GIFs, and IMDb, for movie synopsis and trailers.
